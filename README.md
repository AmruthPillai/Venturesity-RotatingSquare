# Rotating A Square
A #Venturesity #NeedForCode Challenge Submission

### Problem Statement
This challenge is slightly off the beaten track. Itâ€™s quite simple:
* Draw a square on the center of the screen. The size can be any reasonable size of your choice.
* If you are programming in C/C++ or Java, have the square rotate when the user presses the down arrow. Once the user presses the top arrow, the square should stop.
* If you are programming in front end technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript, have the square stop and start rotating at the click of a mouse button.

### Description
The code I have written completes the above challenge and solves the problem statement with precision, and to add to it, it can toggle the animation on/off by either clicking on the document or by using the up/down arrow keys.

##### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* jQuery
